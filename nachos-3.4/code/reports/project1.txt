EXERCISE 1 NOTES
Part 1)
After updating the code for SimpleThread() and testing values 0-4, I was originally confused by a couple things. Firstly, 
the output for n=0 and n=1 is identical except n=0 claims that “0 threads are running”, however this is easily explained
by the fact that the for loop inside the updated ThreadTest() evaluates to false for both n=0 and n=1, and only calls 
SimpleThread(0). 

The second thing that confused me is that for all tests 0 through 4, all threads looped in order, saw the same shared value,
and then saw the same final value. I was not sure if they were already synchronized. But after looking at the code, I 
believe that proper synchronization will allow the threads to take turns adding 1 at each stage, thus they should all 
see increments of 1, but still see the same final value. I will implement the semaphores and see.
