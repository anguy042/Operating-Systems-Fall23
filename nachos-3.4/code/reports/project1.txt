PROJECT 1 REPORT
GROUP 15

Note to graders: We were not consistent in using the "CHANGED" flag for all changes. However, Nachos should still running
in the default settings and run our tests as expected with the different flags specified for Project 1. 

EXERCISE 1 NOTES

After updating the code for SimpleThread() and testing values 0-4, I was originally confused by a couple things. Firstly, 
the output for n=0 and n=1 is identical except n=0 claims that “0 threads are running”, however this is easily explained
by the fact that the for loop inside the updated ThreadTest() evaluates to false for both n=0 and n=1, and only calls 
SimpleThread(0). 

The second thing that confused me is that for all tests 0 through 4, all threads looped in order, saw the same shared value,
and then saw the same final value. I was not sure if they were already synchronized. But after looking at the code, I 
believe that proper synchronization will allow the threads to take turns adding 1 at each stage, thus they should all 
see increments of 1, but still see the same final value. I will implement the semaphores and see. 

After implementing the semaphores, I can see that now the threads each take turns incrementing the value by 1,
and then they all see the same value at the end. Even when the -rs value is used the threads take turns out of order.

EXCERCISE 2 NOTES
Excercise 2 is complete, all condition functions are implemented.

EXCERCISE 3 NOTES
Excercise 3 is complete, all condition functions are implemented.

EXCERCISE 4 NOTES
Excercise 4 is complete, all condition functions are implemented.

OBSERVATION

We are having issues running different tests using the make file input
It always work if we use "DEFINES = -DTHREADS -DHW1_CONDITION" and change what is been tested on main.cc line 134
So, to test elevatorTest, we can replace "Ping();" with "ElevatorTest(10, 10);".
